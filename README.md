# ToDo-List
## Project Description:
In this project, I have developed a to-do list using a backend environment. 
Users can add their work after clicking the '+' button. 
After completing their work they can delete their work by clicking the checkbox.

## How does it work?
When users add their to-do list items, it stores in the database and redirected to the page from where it is requested. 
When users click on the checked button again it gets deleted from the database and redirects to the page from where it is requested.

## Tools used:
I used node.js, ejs, express.js, and its dependencies like body-parser, etc. I used mongoose, which is a framework of MongoDB database, to store data. 

Thanks for visiting my repo.
