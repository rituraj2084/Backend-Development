# ToDo-List
## Project Description:
In this project, I have developed a to do list with using backend environment. 
Users can add their work after clicking '+' button.
After completing their work they can delete their work by clicking checkbox.

## How it works??
When users add their to do list items, it stores in the database and redirected to the page from where it is requested.
When users clicks on the checked button again it gets deleted from the database and redirect to the page from where it is requested.

## Tools used:
I used node.js, ejs, express.js and its depencies like body-parser etc. I used mongoose, which is aframework of MongoDB database, to store data. 

Thanks for visiting my repo.
